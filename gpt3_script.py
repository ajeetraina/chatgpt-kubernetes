# The gpt3_script.py file will depend on what specific task or application you are trying to accomplish with GPT-3. 
# However, here's an example of how the file might look like for a simple script that generates text using GPT-3:
# In this script, openai library is imported, it's used to interact with the GPT-3 API. 
# An API_KEY is added, This is a required step to access the GPT-3 API.
# Then, a function generate_text() is defined which takes a prompt as input and returns a generated text as output. Inside the function, openai.Completion.create() is called to generate text based on the prompt. The engine, prompt, max_tokens, n, stop and temperature arguments can be adjusted to suit your specific needs.
# Finally, the script calls the generate_text() function with a specific prompt and assigns the output to the generated_text variable, which is then printed to the console.
# This is just an example of how the script might look like, you might need to adjust it based on your use-case.

import openai

# Add your OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

def generate_text(prompt):
    completions = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-002",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=1024,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.7,
    )

    message = completions.choices[0].text
    return message.strip()

generated_text = generate_text("Write a short story about a robot who wants to be human")
print(generated_text)
